- [ ] Choose and set up C++ development environment
- [ ] Set up build system (e.g., CMake)

## 2. Core Functionality Development (Weeks 2-4)

### 2.1 File System Monitoring

- [ ] Implement file system watcher to detect changes
- [ ] Develop logic to identify relevant file modifications

### 2.2 Comment Extraction

- [ ] Develop parser for extracting TODO comments from files
- [ ] Implement support for multiple programming languages
- [ ] Create system for tracking comment metadata (file path, line number)

### 2.3 Buffer File Management

- [ ] Implement buffer file creation and updating mechanism
- [ ] Develop efficient read/write operations for buffer files
- [ ] Create system for managing buffer files across directories

### 2.4 Background Service

- [ ] Develop main service loop
- [ ] Implement daemonization process
- [ ] Create signal handling for graceful shutdown

## 3. Command-Line Interface Development (Week 5)

### 3.1 CLI Design

- [ ] Design user-friendly command structure
- [ ] Plan output formats for displaying TODO comments

### 3.2 CLI Implementation

- [ ] Develop command parsing system
- [ ] Implement commands for listing, filtering, and searching TODOs
- [ ] Create formatted output for TODO comments

## 4. Integration and Testing (Week 6)

### 4.1 System Integration

- [ ] Integrate background service with CLI
- [ ] Ensure smooth communication between components

### 4.2 Testing

- [ ] Develop unit tests for each component
- [ ] Create integration tests for the entire system
- [ ] Perform thorough testing with various codebases and scenarios

## 5. Performance Optimization (Week 7)

### 5.1 Profiling

- [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Analyze memory usage and optimize where necessary

### 5.2 Optimization

- [ ] Implement multi-threading for parallel processing
- [ ] Optimize file I/O operations
- [ ] Refine algorithms for better performance

## 6. Deployment Preparation (Week 8)

### 6.1 Documentation

- [ ] Write comprehensive README
- [ ] Create man pages for CLI commands
- [ ] Document configuration options and file formats

### 6.2 Installation Scripts

- [ ] Develop installation script
- [ ] Create update mechanism
- [ ] Implement uninstallation script

### 6.3 Service Management

- [ ] Create systemd service file
- [ ] Develop scripts for starting, stopping, and restarting the service

## 7. Packaging and Distribution (Week 9)

### 7.1 Packaging

- [ ] Create a distributable package (e.g., .tar.gz)
- [ ] Include all necessary files (binary, scripts, documentation)

### 7.2 Testing Deployment

- [ ] Test installation process on various Unix-based systems
- [ ] Verify auto-start functionality
- [ ] Test update and uninstallation processes

## 8. Final Testing and Launch (Week 10)

### 8.1 Final Testing

- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire system
- [ ] Perform stress testing with large codebases

### 8.2 Launch Preparation

- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Set up a system for user feedback and bug reports

### 8.3 Launch

- [ ] Release the software
- [ ] Announce the release on relevant platforms

## 9. Post-Launch (Ongoing)

### 9.1 Maintenance

- [ ] Monitor for bug reports and user feedback
- [ ] Provide timely updates and bug fixes

### 9.2 Feature Expansion
